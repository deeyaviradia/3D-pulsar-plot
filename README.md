# What is this project?

There are reasons to believe that the interstellar medium (ISM) around pulsars is significantly different from the rest of the Galaxy. This is a 3D plot that helps to visualize the known pulsars between the ages of 10e3 and 10e6 based on declination and right ascension. The size of the bubbles represents the age of the pulsar (the older the pulsar, the larger the bubble). The data for the project came from the ATNF PSR catalog - https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/.
